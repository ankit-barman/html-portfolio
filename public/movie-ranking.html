<h1>Best Movies According to Ankit</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all time.</h2>
<hr \ />
<h3>The Shawshank Redemption</h3>
<p>
  "The Shawshank Redemption" is a movie about time, patience and loyalty -- not
  sexy qualities, perhaps, but they grow on you during the subterranean progress
  of this story, which is about how two men serving life sentences in prison
  become friends and find a way to fight off despair.
</p>
<h3>The Pianist</h3>
<p>
  Roman Polanski's "The Pianist" tells the story of a Polish Jew, a classical
  musician, who survived the Holocaust through stoicism and good luck. This is
  not a thriller, and avoids any temptation to crank up suspense or sentiment;
  it is the pianist's witness to what he saw and what happened to him. That he
  survived was not a victory when all whom he loved died
</p>
<h3>Shutter Island</h3>
<p>
  This is Martin Scorsese's evocation of the delicious shuddering fear we feel
  when horror movies are about something and don't release all the tension with
  action scenes.
